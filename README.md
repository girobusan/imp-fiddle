==========

Local, JSFiddle-like tool.

- Fully local, no server required
- Saves your work in single file
- It's possible to embed data (CSV or JSON) in the same file
- Supports SEO tags, can be shared via any hosting provider
- Can display only resulted HTML, without loading an editor. Can be used as mini-CMS this way.
